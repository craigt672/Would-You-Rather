# Would You Rather Project

## Project Purpose:

This game was built for the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React/Redux based app.

## How to Load the App

The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-App starter. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: Node.js

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app

git clone https://github.com/macbwoy/Would-You-Rather.git
npm install
Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with

npm start

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser
